# Single Sign On with Android

This project is a prove of concept. It is integrated by a Launcher app, a Single Sign On 1 app which has the same signature as the Launcher (this simulates that it was produced by the same company that developed the Launcher), a Third party app (with different signature) and an sso server. 
A user needs to login into the Launcher to be able of use the other apps (OpenID authentication), once the user is logged, the Single Sing On 1 app can access to the user account info (username, access token) directly from the android Account Manager, because it has the same signature as the Launcher. For the Third party app to be able to access that account info it can bind to a Launcher's bound service.
To prevent any unpermitted third party app can access the account info, the bound service require that the third party app send a code when asking for the account info, that code is generated by the sso server, which only generates a code if the third party app is a permitted client. When the bound servive receives the request from the third party app, it validates the code with the sso server, and if the code is valid, sends the account info to the third party app.
